The script collects all the words listed, and sends them back to the browser.
The maximum score achievable is 360 words per minute as the server does not list more than 360 words. The script finishes 'typing' in all 360 words in under 8 seconds. 

## Running the script

1. Download the chrome web driver [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)
2. Change the path in the script to your web driver's path
3. Run the script
4. The script launches the browser, opens the site and starts 'typing'

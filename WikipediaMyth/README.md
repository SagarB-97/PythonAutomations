# Wikipedia Myth

Clicking on the first link in the main text of a Wikipedia article, and then repeating the process for subsequent articles, will usually lead to the **Philosophy** article.

Full article : [Getting to Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy)

The script takes as input any Wikipedia link, and crawls through all the first links, until it reaches *Philosophy* wikipedia article.
The titles of all pages that the script crawls through are printed on the terminal.

## Running the script

1. Download `lxml` python package if not already present in your Python distribution 
2. Run the script
3. Input the link to a Wikipedia article
